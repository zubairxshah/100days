**Welcome to Advanced Word Counter** by Zubair Shah

The project will count words in sentence provided through user input.
The white spaces will be removed from the sentence to count exact words in the line.
There is an option to count total letters, total white spaces, and total characters as well.
A loop is introduced to repeat the input process to try another sentence.
Choices will be asked to end the program, otherwise it will keep the program running.
